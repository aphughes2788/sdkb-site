                <p>Kendo is the art of Japanese fencing. &quot;Ken&quot; (剣) is from the character meaning "sword". The character
                &quot;Do&quot;（道）means "way or path" and translates to, &quot;The way of the sword&quot;.</p>
                <h3>A Brief History of Kendo:</h3>

                <p style="font-style: italic;">From the AUSKF website:</p>
                <p>"Modern Kendo bears but faint resemblance to Kenjutsu and to its feudal origins of sword wielding samurai warriors which are today depicted in movies and television. Kendo, literally translated, the way of the sword, cannot be traced to a single founder or given an exact founding date. The story of the rise of modern Kendo begins with the samurai and extends over the culture of several centuries.</p>

                <p>By the end of the 12th century, the authority of the Japanese central government had declined. Bands of warriors
                    grouped together for protection forming local aristocracies. Feudalism had come of age, and was to dominate
                    Japan for several centuries. With the establishment of the Shogun in Kamakura and military rule controlling Japan,
                    a new military class and their lifestyle called Bushido, the way of the warrior, gained prominence. Bushido stressed
                    the virtues of bravery, loyalty, honor, self-discipline and stoical acceptance of death. Certainly, the influence of
                Bushido extended to modern Japanese society and Kendo was also to be greatly influenced by this thinking.</p>

                <p>The Japanese warrior had no contempt for learning or the arts. Although Kenjutsu, the art of swordsmanship, had
                    been recorded since the 8th century, it gained new prominence and took on religious and cultural aspects as well.
                    Sword making became a revered art. Zen and other sects of Buddhism developed and the samurai often devoted
                time to fine calligraphy or poetry.</p>

                <p>The next great advance in the martial arts occurred during the late Muromachi Period (1336-1568) often call the
                    Age of Warring Provinces because of the many internal conflicts. This period brought an increased demand and
                    respect for men trained in the martial arts. Consequently, many schools of Kenjutsu arose, eventually numbering
                    about 200. Each was taught by a famous swordsman whose techniques earned him honor in battle. Real blades or
                    hardwood swords without protective equipment were used in training resulting in many injuries. These schools

                    continued to flourish through the Tokugawa period (1600-1868), with the Ittoryu or "one sword school", having
                the greatest influence on modern Kendo.</p>

                <p>Kendo began to take its modern appearance during the late 18th century with the introduction of protective
                    equipment: the men, kote and do and the use of the bamboo sword, the shinai. The use of the shinai and
                    protective armor made possible the full delivery of blows without injury. This forced the establishment of new
                regulations and practice formats which set the foundation of modern Kendo.</p>

                <p>With the Meiji Restoration (1868) and Japanese entry into the modern world, Kendo suffered a great decline. The
                    Samurai class was abolished and the wearing of swords in public outlawed. This decline was only temporary,
                    however, interest in Kendo was revived first in 1887 when uprisings against the government showed the need for
                    the training of police officers. Later the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05) again
                encouraged an awareness of the martial spirit.</p>

                <p>Consequently in 1895, the Butokukai, an organization devoted to the martial arts was established. In 1911, Kendo
                    was officially introduced into the physical education curriculum of middle schools and in 1912, the Nihon Kendo
                    Kata, a set of regulations for Kendo, was published. In 1939 as Japan prepared for war, Kendo became a required
                course for all boys.</p>

                <p>After the war, because of its nationalistic and militaristic associations, Kendo was outlawed and the Butokukai was
                    disbanded. However by 1952, supporters of Kendo successfully reintroduced a pure sport form of Kendo, called
                    Shinai Kyogi which excluded the militaristic attitudes and some of the rougher aspects of practice characteristic of
                    prewar Kendo, into the public schools. Today, Kendo continues to grow under the auspices of the All Japan Kendo
                Federation, the International Kendo Federation, and federations all over the world.</p>

                <p>Although the outward appearance and some of the ideals have changed with the changing needs of the people,
                    Kendo continues to build character, self-discipline and respect. Despite a sportlike atmosphere, Kendo remains
                    steeped in tradition which must never be forgotten. For here lies the strength of Kendo which has carried it
                throughout history and will carry it far into the future."</p>
