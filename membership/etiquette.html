                <h1 class="text-center">Kendo Etiquette</h1>


                <p>Kendo has many established customs and traditions that may take some time to get used to.</p>
                <p>You will likely make mistakes at first, and that's ok! Part of learning kendo is learning about how
                the etiquette and culture meld with the sport.</p>
                <p>At SDKB, instructors teach on a voluntary basis. All costs goes towards supporting the
                    facility so that we have a practice space. As such, we ask that you observe basic rules in the
                dojo.</p>
                <p>The basic etiquette is known as reigi, and while different martial arts may have different
                protocols, the idea of reigi is universal.</p>
                <p>Here's a primer on our standard for "rei-ho" or etiquette at San Diego Kendo Bu. The most
                    important thing is to always be humble and respectful. Accept criticism willingly and be open to
                learning.The rest will come with practice and experience.</p>
                <p>Always be mindful of the club's existing hierarchy, which is based on seniority and rank. Senpai
                    are the members that are senior to you. Sensei refer to the instructors who are 4-Dan and
                above.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions, about kendo etiquette or just in general, please don't hesitate to ask
                one of your sensei or senpai!</p>
                <h5 style="font-style: italic;">From the SCKF 1996 AUSKF Team Commemorative Booklet</h5>
                <p>"Etiquette is an extremely important part of Kendo. The basic rules come from the formal,
                    highly stylised social system of Japan. Simply stated, Kendo etiquette is based on respect -- for
                one's Sensei, seniors, equipment, etc.</p>
                <p>In practice, it is not that simple. There is a prescribed method for virtually every action, and
                    failure to adhere to proper behavior may be taken as a sign of poor instruction or, in some
                cases, as a severe insult. It is essential to know basic etiquette in Kendo."</p>
                <p>Below are some of the basics:</p>

                <h3>General Dojo Rules:</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Arrive early to practice so you can get dressed and ready. On-time is late!</li>
                    <li>Greet everyone in the dojo eagerly when you come to practice, especially all sensei. Do
                    this also when leaving practice. This is called "ai-satsu".</li>
                    <li>Take your shoes off before entering the dojo and when stepping out of the dojo</li>
                    <li>Stop and bow before entering and exiting the dojo
                        <li>Never deliver traditional courtesies in a casual or off-hand manner.</li>

                        <li>Always address the sensei by their title, "Sensei" after their last name.</li>
                        <li>Avoid walking in front of Sensei, or in front of Kenshi seated in the seiza position. If you
                            need to walk in front of another player, move your arm out in front at a 45 degree angle
                        and bow slightly while passing.</li>
                        <li>Be aware of junior members and take care of them.</li>
                        <li>Always sit or stand properly when in the dojo. Do not slouch or lean against anything.  Particularly,do not lean on your shinai. Do not crawl to adjust your position when in seiza, or sonkyo; instead, stand up and move.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Wearing Apparel and Equipment</h5>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Practice wearing bogu until you can put the whole set on in less than 3 minutes (you
                        should be able to put it on faster than your senpai!)</li>
                        <li>Always sit in seiza when putting on or fixing your bogu.</li>

                        <li>Wear your keikogi and hakama neatly. Make sure the keikogi is smooth, not bulging, in
                            the front and back. When putting on the hakama, put your left leg in first; when
                        removing the hakama, remove your right left first.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Treating Shinai with Respect</h5>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Always treat the shinai with respect and care, just as if it was a real sword. The side
                        opposite the tsuru (binding cord) represents the cutting edge.</li>
                        <li>Always handle your shinai respectfully. Do not lean on it, rest it on the floor, twirl it, or
                            drag it. Make sure it is well maintained, free of splinters and with tightened tsuru
                        (string) and nakayui (leather strap).</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Never do the following:</h5>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Lean on shinai.</li>
                        <li>Hold shinai over one’s shoulder.</li>
                        <li>Step or jump over shinai and bogu.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>When resting shinai against the wall:</h5>

                    <ol>
                        <li>When resting shinai against the wall:</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Additional Notes</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Do not speak when sensei is giving instructions.</li>
                        <li>Keep idle conversations to a minimum.</li>
                        <li>Respond/reply to instructions ("hai").</li>
                        <li>Use proper honorifics (address sensei simply as "sensei").</li>
                        <li>Always bow and give thanks when given advice or instructions by sensei or senpai.</li>
                        <li>Bow slightly when walking across in front of members in seiza (it is best if possible to
                        walk behind members seated in seiza).</li>
                    </ol>
