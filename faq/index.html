                <p><strong>Q: May anyone join the dojo?</strong></p>

                <p>A: YES! San Diego Kendo Bu is open to all ages and abilities. Our dojo teaches both children and adults and is well-known for its openness and acceptance of our diverse membership. The dojo is family-friendly and is well-known in the local community for the friendliness and welcoming nature of our members.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: I heard that San Diego Kendo Bu has the most practice opportunities of any dojo in San Diego. When are practices?</strong></p>

                <p>A: Yes, this is true! SDKB practices on Tues/Thurs 7-8pm for beginners and 8-10pm for advanced players at our dojo in Liberty Station, and at UCSD’s Rec Gym on Saturday from 12-2pm.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: What Happens in Kendo Practice?</strong></p>

                <p>A: A Kendo practice is composed of many types of training. Each type has a different
                    purpose for developing the Kendo student. Kendo, like other martial arts requires
                discipline and a dedication to training.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>A new student begins with learning the basics such as: etiquette (reigi), different
                        postures and footwork, and how to properly swing a sword. The student
                        progresses through a series of skills preparing them to begin training with armor
                    (bogu).</li>

                    <li>Once a student begins to practice in armor, a practice may be composed of any
                        or all of the following types of practice and this will depend upon what the
                        instructor&#39;s focus is at a particular time:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Kiri-Kaeshi: successively striking the left and right men, practice
                            centering, distance, and proper cutting while building spirit and stamina.</li>
                            <li>Waza-Geiko: technique practice in which the student learns to use the
                            many techniques of Kendo with a receiving partner.</li>
                            <li>Kakari-Geiko: short, intense, attack practice which teaches continuous
                                alertness, the ability to attack no matter what has come before, as well as
                            building spirit and stamina.</li>

                            <li>Ji-Geiko: sparring practice where the kenshi has a chance to try all that he
                            or she has learned with a resisting partner.</li>
                            <li>Gokaku-Geiko: sparring practice between two kenshi of similar skill level.</li>
                            <li>Hikitate-Geiko: sparring practice where a senior kenshi guides a junior
                            kenshi through practice.</li>
                            <li>hiai-Geiko: competition matches which are judged on the basis of a
                            person scoring valid cuts against an opponent.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Q: Do I need to speak Japanese to participate?</strong></p>

                <p>A: No, but we encourage our members to learn kendo vocabulary, such as Japanese
                    counting terms, etiquette phrases, and terms for the body parts and techniques. Here is a link
                    to a reference guide from SCKF, including information on vocabulary and etiquette. <a href="https://www.eanet.com/sckf/refinfo.htm" target="_blank">https://www.eanet.com/sckf/refinfo.htm</a></p>

                    <p><strong>Q: Does it hurt when you get hit?</strong></p>

                    <p>A: Not usually, but sometimes when an opponent misses the target, it can hurt a bit.
                        Kendo is a martial art, so there is some physicality expected. The benefit is that the players are
                    armored, and the dojo members work hard to take care of each others’ health and safety.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: Are there a lot of injuries in kendo?</strong></p>

                    <p>A: Kendo injuries are less frequent than all other martial arts, and less frequent than
                        most other mainstream sports in the USA. This was studied in a large research article published
                        in The Physician and Sports Medicine, which can be viewed here: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00913847.2016.1105093" target="_blank">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00913847.2016.1105093</a></p>

                        <p><strong>Q: Where may I purchase kendo equipment?</strong></p>

                        <p>A: There are many companies, both local and international, that sell kendo equipment.
                            Here are links to some of the companies available that our members have used:
                            <ul>

                        <p><strong>Q: What’s with all the bowing and “arigatou gozimashita” at practice?</strong></p>

                        <p>A: Etiquette is central to kendo and is an important part of life in our dojo. Here’s some
                            tips on how you can show good etiquette in the dojo, or practice “rei-ho”:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Greet everyone in the dojo eagerly when you come to practice, especially the
                                sensei. This is called “ai-satsu”</li>
                                <li>Take your shoes off before entering the dojo and when stepping out of the dojo</li>
                                <li>Bow before entering and exiting the dojo</li>
                                <li>Say “onegaishimasu” (please) before a drill and “arigatou gozaimashita” after a
                                drill</li>
                                <li>Do not leave the practice unless it is an emergency, and notify the head
                                instructor if you need to take a break</li>
                                <li>Do not leave a sensei’s line empty</li>
                                <li>Always line up with and bow to each sensei after practice, even if you did not get
                                the opportunity to practice with them</li>
                            </ul>

                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Q: How do I bow properly?</strong></p>

                        <p>A: There are two kind of bowing in kendo:

                            <ul>
                                <li>The majority of bows are with at a 15 degree angle, but at the start/finish
                                of kata, we bow at a 30 degree angle.</li>
                                <li>Keep your neck in line with the back, meaning do not tilt the head.</li>
                                <li>Keep your eyes on the toes of your opponent, and don’t look at the floor
                                when bowing. (Never take your eyes off of your opponent)</li>
                            </ul>

                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Q: Are there belts in kendo?</strong></p>

                        <p>A: Not in the way that most people think. There are no colored belts or outward signs of
                            rank in kendo. Ranking is done by numeric value.

                            <ul>
                                <li>The term “kyu” means “class”, often referred to as “mudansha” or “unranked”,
                                    and refers to anyone who has not reached the “dan/yudansha” or “ranked”
                                level.</li>
                                <li>1-Dan is equivalent to 1 st degree black belt in most martial arts. Kyu-level
                                    students rank up in descending order until they reach 1-kyu, then ascending
                                order once they reach 1-Dan.</li>
                                <li>4-Dan is the first rank that grants the title of Sensei.</li>
                                <li>8-Dan is the highest rank in kendo.</li>

                                <li>There are also added degrees of renshi, kyoshi, and hanshi that are added to the
                                highest level sensei from 6-Dan and above.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </p>


                        <p><strong>Q: What is the etiquette when visiting a dojo for the first time?</strong></p>

                        <p>A: Etiquette in any Japanese martial art is central to learning. It’s important to make a
                            good first impression as well when visiting a new dojo or joining for the first time. Here are
                            some tips:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Email or call the dojo contact person ahead of time and ask permission to
                                    join the practice; don’t just show up and expect to join, as there may be
                                    certain dates with closed practices, or holiday seasons where practice may be
                                    cancelled. Some dojos ask new players to come observe before joining the
                                practice.</li>
                                <li>Come early to practice and make sure that your equipment is clean and
                                ready.</li>
                                <li>Introduce yourself eagerly and meet your contact. Bringing a small token
                                    from your home dojo to a visiting dojo is never expected, but is a good way
                                to strengthen bonds between players and dojos.</li>
                                <li>Learn from your contact person who the sensei and members are and who
                                    the head instructor is, as this may not be obvious. Understand who to ask
                                questions to during and after practice.</li>
                                <li>Be prepared to spend some quality time (perhaps drinks?) with the dojo you
                                    visit after practice. This is also a way that kendo players strengthen bonds
